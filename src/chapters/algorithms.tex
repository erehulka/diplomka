In this chapter we provide known algorithms to determine cyclic edge connectivity of graphs. It is a long standing problem, whether to determine cyclic edge connectivity of an arbitrary graph is in $P$ \todo{zdroj?}. However, there are several polynomial algorithms for determining the cyclic edge connectivity of graphs with some specific attributes.
