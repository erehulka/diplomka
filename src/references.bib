@book{Diestel, author = {R. Diestel}, title = {Graph Theory}, year = {2017}, isbn = {3662536218}, publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated}, edition = {5th}, abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis \& Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory. Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book. MAA Reviews A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors. Mathematika ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.

@article{Nedela1996,
	abstract = {According to M. Gardner ["Mathematical Games: Snarks, Boojums, and Other Conjectures Related to the Four-Color-Map Theorem," Scientific American, vol. 234 (1976), pp. 126-130], a snark is a nontrivial cubic graph whose edges cannot be properly colored by three colors. The problem of what "nontrivial" means is implicitly or explicitly present in most papers on snarks, and is the main motivation of the present paper. Our approach to the discussion is based on the following observation. If G is a snark with a k-edge-cut producing components G1 and G2, then either one of G1 and G2 is not 3-edge-colorable or by adding a "small" number of vertices to either component one can obtain snarks G̃1 and G̃2 whose order does not exceed that of G. The two situations lead to a definition of a k-reduction and k-decomposition of G. Snarks that for m < k do not admit m-reductions, m-decompositions, or both are k-irreducible, k-indecomposable, and k-simple, respectively. The irreducibility, indecomposability, and simplicity provide natural measures of nontriviality of snarks closely related to cyclic connectivity. The present paper is devoted to a detailed investigation of these invariants. The results give a complete characterization of irreducible snarks and characterizations of k-simple snarks for k ≤ 6. A number of problems that have arisen in this research conclude the paper. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},
